Terraform module to provision an EKS Managed Node Group for [Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).

Instantiate it multiple times to create EKS Managed Node Groups with specific settings such as GPUs, EC2 instance types, or autoscale parameters.

**IMPORTANT:** When SSH access is enabled without specifying a source security group, this module provisions `EKS Node Group` nodes that are globally accessible by SSH (22) port. Normally, AWS recommends that no security group allows unrestricted ingress access to port 22 .


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).

## Introduction

This module creates an [EKS Managed Node Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html)
for an [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) cluster.
It assumes you have already created an EKS cluster, but you can create the cluster and the node group in the
same Terraform configuration. See our
[full-featured root module (a.k.a. component) `eks/cluster`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/tree/main/modules/eks/cluster)
for an example of how to do that.

### Launch Templates

This module always uses a [launch template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-templates.html)
to create the node group. You can create your own launch template and
pass in its ID, or else this module will create one for you.

The AWS default for EKS is that if the launch template is updated, the existing nodes will not be affected. Only
new instances added to the node group would get the changes specified in the new launch template. In contrast,
when the launch template changes, this module can immediately create a new node group from the new launch template
to replace the old one.

See the inputs `create_before_destroy` and `immediately_apply_lt_changes` for details about how to control this behavior.

### Operating system differences

Currently, EKS supports 4 Operating Systems: Amazon Linux 2, Amazon Linux 2023, Bottlerocket, and Windows Server.
This module supports all 4 OSes, but support for detailed configuration of the nodes varies by OS. The 4 inputs:

1. `before_cluster_joining_userdata`
2. `kubelet_additional_options`
3. `bootstrap_additional_options`
4. `after_cluster_joining_userdata`

are fully supported for Amazon Linux 2 and Windows, and take advantage of the [bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/main/templates/al2/runtime/bootstrap.sh)
supplied on those AMIs. **NONE** of these inputs are supported on Bottlerocket. On AL2023, only the first 2 are supported.

Note that for all OSes, you can supply the complete `userdata` contents, which will be untouched by this module, via `userdata_override_base64`.

## Usage


### Major Changes (breaking and otherwise)

With the v3.0.0 release of this module, support for Amazon Linux 2023 (AL2023) has
been added, and some breaking changes have been made. Please see the
[release notes](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-node-group/releases/tag/3.0.0)
for details.

With the v2.0.0 (a.k.a. v0.25.0) release of this module, it has undergone major breaking
changes and added new features. Please see the [migration](docs/migration-v1-v2.md)
document for details.


For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) (which tests and deploys the example on AWS),
see [test](test).

### Sources of Information

- The code examples below are manually updated and have a tendency to fall out of sync with actual code,
particularly with respect to usage of other modules. Do not rely on them.
- The documentation on this page about this module's inputs, outputs, and compliance is all automatically
generated and is up-to-date as of the release date. After the code itself, this is your best source of information.
- The code in [examples/complete](examples/complete) is automatically tested before every release,
so that is a good place to look for verified example code. Keep in mind, however, it is code for testing, so
it may not represent average use cases or best practices.
- Of course, the READMEs and `examples/complete` directories in the other modules' GitHub repos
are more authoritative with respect to how to use those modules than this README is.

#### Example Code

```hcl

  max_size              = var.max_size
  cluster_name          = module.eks_cluster.eks_cluster_id
  create_before_destroy = true
  kubernetes_version    = var.kubernetes_version == null || var.kubernetes_version == "" ? [] : [var.kubernetes_version]

  # Enable the Kubernetes cluster auto-scaler to find the auto-scaling group
  cluster_autoscaler_enabled = var.autoscaling_policies_enabled

  context = module.label.context

  # Ensure the cluster is fully created before trying to add the node group
  module_depends_on = [module.eks_cluster.kubernetes_config_map_id]
}

```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.

## Windows Managed Node groups

Windows managed node-groups have a few pre-requisites.

* Your cluster must contain at least one linux based worker node
* Your EKS Cluster must have the `AmazonEKSVPCResourceController` and `AmazonEKSClusterPolicy` policies attached
* Your cluster must have a config-map called amazon-vpc-cni with the following content

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
name: amazon-vpc-cni
namespace: kube-system
data:
enable-windows-ipam: "true"
```

* Windows nodes will automatically be tainted

```yaml
kubernetes_taints = [{
  key    = "WINDOWS"
  value  = "true"
  effect = "NO_SCHEDULE"
}]
```
* Any pods that target Windows will need to have the following attributes set in their manifest

```yaml
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/os: windows
    kubernetes.io/arch: amd64
```
